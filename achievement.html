            <h5>As a web developer, the three main languages we use to build websites are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                <br> <br> JavaScript is the programming language, we use HTML to structure the site, and we use CSS to
                design and layout the web page. These days, CSS has become more than just a design language, though.
