        <div class="about">
            <p> <br><br>I’m Amir Ali, but you can just call me Amir. <br><br>Originally living in Lucknow, India from the last
                few years or so I’ve been honing my skills in development, programming and technical roles building
                products for the web, mobile, games and, more recently, AI. <br><br> My career objective is to use my
                knowledge and improvise my skills in an organization that promotes, learning motivation to support the
                growth of individual and an organization. <br><br>I have been awarded certificates by many educational
                platforms such as Coursera, NPTEL, Internshala and NIELET. Like I've done Web Development courses from
                Coursera Johns Hopkins University and Internshala Trainings also Course on Computer Concepts from
                National Institute of Electronics & Information Technology and also Enhancing Soft Skills and
                Personality and Data Science for Engineers course from NPTEL and I'll do more courses in future too to
                gain some more skills and knowledge. I'll attach my certifications in achievement section. <br><br> I
                also have a Youtube channel named Amir Ali Vines where i made some comedy skits which is just a hobby
                because i don't do youtube full-time. It's just a part-time channel. So talking about hobbies I love to
                play Cricket.</p>
